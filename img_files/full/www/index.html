<h1>Motor OS</h1>
<p>Motūrus project builds a simple, fast, and secure operating system (Motor OS) for the cloud.</p>
<p>In more specific terms, Motor OS is a new microkernel-based operating system,
built in Rust, that targets virtualized workloads exclusively.
It currently supports x64 KVM-based virtual machines, and can run in Qemu, Cloud Hypervisor, or Alioth VMMs.
Rust is the language of Motor OS: it not only is implemented in Rust, its system libraries (syscalls, etc.)
are also implemented in Rust and are designed with Rust-based client applications in mind.</p>
